## Description
This is an example of using [Haml](http://haml.info) from the command line.

The [generate.rb](generate.rb) file has a decent number of comments that should help you understand what's going on.  In addition, I wrote a [blog post](http://blog.seancarpenter.net/2013/05/24/using-haml-from-the-command-line/) that provides some background and explanation.

## Usage
To run this example, first do a `bundle install` to get the necessary gems.  Then running `./generate.rb` from the repository root will generate `index.html` and `another_page.html` as examples.
